# Disaster Detection

This project focuses on detecting and analyzing disasters using Python and related technologies. The goal is to process and analyze data to identify potential disaster events, enabling quicker responses and informed decision-making.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning for disaster-related datasets.
- Implementation of machine learning or deep learning models for disaster prediction and detection.
- Visualization of results for better insights into disaster trends and patterns.
- Modular and reusable code structure for ease of maintenance and updates.

## Requirements

The project uses the following Python libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn

To install these dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
